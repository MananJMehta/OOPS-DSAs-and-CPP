This program displays a few attributes of the famous Gettysburg address by Abe Lincoln.

Input a text file of the address and it will display:
Number of Lines
Number of Characters
Number of Words
Number of Uppercase letters
Number of Lowercase letters
Number of spaces
Number of punctuation marks

This was my first CPP program to read a text file using the ifstream class.
